I am taking part in #dk30-spring-2019 which you can find [here](https://dk30.day9.tv/?t=1554317248024).

The Project is structured into 4 Weeks. MY output should be thirteen blog posts and an interactable cloud thing.
In order to get a clean front page I am creating this post so I can collect my links while I move the project forward.

Week 1:
I am a proud owner of an [AWS ](https://aws.amazon.com)evaluation account which will last for a year.
Thinking about what may come in handy in week 4 and what I want to accomplish I think what I need will contain:

- Hosting a remote machine for actual development in the cloud.
- Hosting a CI / CD container that automates josb.
- Hosting a package repository to store my artifacts
- Integrating CI CD with artifact storage
- Hosting orchestration
- Scaling orchestration
- Integrating CI CD with orchestration
- Using a webservice for authentication
- Running a db container
- regular db backups and recovery
- service replication for geo locations
- client side computation
- twitter integration

Looking at that list makes me feel a bit squeamy since I know those topics a bit and I am not sure If I have enough pare time to pull this off in a month.
Never give up, never surrender :)
