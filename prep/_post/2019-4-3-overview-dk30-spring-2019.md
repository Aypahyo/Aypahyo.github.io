I am taking part in #dk30-spring-2019 which you can find [here](https://dk30.day9.tv/?t=1554317248024).

The Project is structured into 4 Weeks. MY output should be thirteen blog posts and an interactable cloud thing.
In order to get a clean front page I am creating this post so I can collect my links while I move the project forward.

Week 1:
I am a proud owner of an [AWS ](https://aws.amazon.com)evaluation account which will last for a year.
Thinking about what may come in handy in week 4 and what I want to accomplish I think what I need will contain:
<ul>
	<li>Hosting a remote machine for actual development in the cloud.</li>
	<li>Hosting a CI / CD container that automates josb.</li>
	<li>Hosting a package repository to store my artifacts</li>
	<li>Integrating CI CD with artifact storage</li>
	<li>Hosting orchestration</li>
	<li>Scaling orchestration</li>
	<li>Integrating CI CD with orchestration</li>
	<li>Using a webservice for authentication</li>
	<li>Running a db container</li>
	<li>regular db backups and recovery</li>
	<li>service replication for geo locations</li>
	<li>client side computation</li>
	<li>twitter integration</li>
</ul>
Looking at that list makes me feel a bit squeamy since I know those topics a bit and I am not sure If I have enough pare time to pull this off in a month.
Never give up, never surrender :)
