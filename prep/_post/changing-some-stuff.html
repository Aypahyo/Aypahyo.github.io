I have to rework all of my past posts.

I upload files and images to the server manually because I don't want wordpress to manage that for me. Sometimes I used relative paths to the content which depending on how you look at the posts can end up in broken links. So I have to go back and ensure that all paths are absolute paths.

There are issues with the internet explorer where an article can break all subsequent content. I think it is caused by a conflict with my XML code highlighting. I will go back and remove the highlighting from the XML code snippets.
