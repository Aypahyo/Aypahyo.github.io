title: development on a cloud machine

This is my first ever blogpost. It is more or less just a demonstration for myself and teaches me all the tools and plugins i have to use.

- found a provider who gets my money on a monthly basis.
- installed Wordpress.
- found a plugin for code.
- wrote a code snippet.
- wrote an impressum, mandatory for germans.
- fiddeled with the theme until it was ugly.

```cpp
int random(void){
    //guranteed to be random, rolled it myself
    return 4;
}
```

*Files*
I plan to provide files whenever i do something with code, this time i will skip that.
